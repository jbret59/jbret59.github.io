            <b>Why did we choose this logo?</b> Our logo clearly shows our intentions and what we are doing with this task. The planet tells people that we are associated with space. The name "BioSpace"â„¢ is a mix of our two main focuses; biomedical hub and space.<br><br> <table><tr><td><img width="60%" src="otheroldlogo.png"></td><td><img width="60%" src="otherotheroldlogo.png"></td><td><img width="60%" src="oldlogo.png"></td><td><img width="100%" src="BIOSPACE logo.png"></td></tr><tr><td>we did not use this because the green did not suit the "red planet" that mars is known as and also the black background did not fit our website style.</td><td>we did not use this logo because the green did not fit our intentions of focusing on mars or "the red planet" as more it is commonly known as.</td><td>we did not use this logo because our main intention for the website was for it to be white and even though this logo represents mars well we did not choose it because of the background.</td><td>this was the final logo choice. this is because it has a white background which matches our website and also shows the mars picture very well and was overll the best looking.</td></tr></table><br>
